As the sun dips low and casts its warm glow through the trees, you lead Rachel to the setup of twinkling fairy lights and steaming mugs of hot chocolate.

**"Rachel, I've always admired your dedication to your faith in Christ, your maturity, your practical nature, and your beauty. And so, inspired by your love of science, I decided to conduct an experiment of sorts—an experiment to understand the effect of your presence in my life.

The hypothesis was simple: time spent with you would lead to joy, peace, and wonder. The results? Overwhelmingly positive and statistically significant in every way.

In scientific terms, you are the greatest anomaly I've ever encountered. You defy all expectations and bring clarity to what once felt like chaos.

Tonight, I am submitting a lifetime grant proposal. I am requesting a lifetime of funding—of your love, your laughter, and your companionship. Together, I believe we can build something extraordinary.

So, Rachel, my partner in discovery, my favorite peer reviewer, and the one who inspires me daily—will you accept this grant request and be my wife?"*

You pull out the ring and, with a hopeful smile, await her response as the fairy lights sparkle around you.


Well look here! Someone has left some nice things here, lights, a mug of hot chocolate, and a blanket! This planket actually looks familiar... * Turns on lights * moves to spot *Signals Rachel to come closer. 

"Rachel Lynae Hexamer, there are many things I admire about you—your deep devotion to Christ, your dedication to excellence, and your demure personality. It’s rare to find all these wonderful traits in one person, especially someone I’m also deeply attracted to. The more time we spend together, the more my love for you grows, and I find myself yearning for the day when we can build a life together—a life filled with love, laughter, and shared dreams. You make me a better person, and I can’t imagine my future without you by my side.

Rachel, will you walk this journey of life with me? Will you accept this request to be my wife, to share the highs and lows, the simple moments and the grand adventures together? I can’t imagine my future without you by my side.

Will you marry me?"
