As the sun dips low and casts its warm glow through the trees, you lead Rachel to the setup of twinkling fairy lights and steaming mugs of hot chocolate.

**"Rachel, I've always admired the way you approach life—with curiosity, with care, and with a heart that seems to hold a world of its own. And so, inspired by your love of science, I decided to conduct an experiment of sorts—an experiment to understand the effect of your presence in my life.

The hypothesis was simple: time spent with you would lead to joy, peace, and wonder. The results? Overwhelmingly positive and statistically significant in every way.

In scientific terms, you are the greatest anomaly I've ever encountered. You defy all expectations and bring clarity to what once felt like chaos.

Tonight, I am submitting a lifetime grant proposal. I am requesting a lifetime of funding—of your love, your laughter, and your companionship. Together, I believe we can build something extraordinary.

So, Rachel, my partner in discovery, my favorite peer reviewer, and the one who inspires me daily—will you accept this grant request and be my wife?"*

You pull out the ring and, with a hopeful smile, await her response as the fairy lights sparkle around you.
