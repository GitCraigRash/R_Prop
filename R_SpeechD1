As the sun dips low and casts its warm glow through the trees, you lead Rachel to the setup of twinkling fairy lights and steaming mugs of hot chocolate.

**"Rachel, I've always admired your dedication to your faith in Christ, your maturity, your practical nature, and your beauty. And so, inspired by your love of science, I decided to conduct an experiment of sorts—an experiment to understand the effect of your presence in my life.

In scientific terms, you are the greatest anomaly I've ever encountered. You defy all expectations and bring clarity to what once felt like chaos.

Tonight, I am submitting a lifetime grant proposal. I am requesting a lifetime of funding—of your love, your laughter, and your companionship. Together, I believe we can build something extraordinary.

So, Rachel, my partner in discovery, my favorite peer reviewer, and the one who inspires me daily—will you accept this grant request and be my wife?"*

You pull out the ring and, with a hopeful smile, await her response as the fairy lights sparkle around you.

Rachel, will you walk this journey of life with me? Will you accept this request to be my wife, to share the highs and lows, the simple moments and the grand adventures together? I can’t imagine my future without you by my side.

Will you marry me?"


Reasons I think it would be a good idea: All the legal and financial reasons, personal happiness, an aid with diligence, I used to be perfectly fine with being single, now I would be remise if I could not be by your side day. We can make meals together, exercise, and relax together. Our families like each other, and they love us. My life long prayer partner. I sometimes think what will happen when my freinds and family move away or must pass on , but with you I can bear it.
